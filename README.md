# LearningPython

We might want to consider collaborating on another platform so we can see what each person is doing/thinking in real time. Either that or just use our own computers and jump on a chat client, but Google has that all built in.

We'll see. This does have version tracking and branching, which is nice.


## Getting started

Take a look at these two files for somewhere to start.
* Problem_Problems.md	
* Python_Topics.md
